## The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild Armor Upgrade Tracker

This tracker is designed as a tool to help you keep track of the resources you need to obtain in order to upgrade various armors to specific levels.

Simply make sure the armor you wish to track is checked, then adjust the slider below the name of the armor to specify which levels you are looking to upgrade it to. The resources and the quantity you will need for the upgrades are shown in the sidebar on the left. By default, all levels of all armors are tracked.

### TODO

There are several things that I need to address after launching this app.

- Speed up SQL queries with Redis caching. (Might even need to re-architect the querying altogether.)
- Add a "Select all" and "Deselect all" set of links near the top.
- Add a tri-state checkbox for each armor set to select/deselect all armors in that set.
- Replace the apparently abandoned [Livewire Range Slider](https://github.com/jantinnerezo/livewire-range-slider) with a pure-JavaScript usage of the [noUiSlider](https://refreshless.com/nouislider/).
- Add a Dark Mode toggle next to the User Profile icon
